# FPGA_Tetris
"""
  This repository contains all the code necessary to play tetris over VGA with a DE1_SoC. 
  Created by Lauren Choquer and I for our final project in UW ECE 371.
  Required peripherals:
      PS2 Keyboard
      VGA Monitor
      AUX Speakers
  All verilog code was given to us as drivers, however, all system verilog code is our own creation.
